          Our journey began in late 2022 when our founder,{' '}
          <span className="manrope-semibold">Courtney Walters</span>, recognized
          a critical gap in the business landscape. Having worked extensively
          within San Francisco's startup ecosystem, it became evident that while
          front-office functions like customer success and marketing received
          ample attention, back-office operations were often overlooked. This
          disparity stemmed from the misconception that operations lacked direct
          revenue generation potential.

          Drawing from firsthand experiences, Courtney realized the
          <span className="manrope-semibold">
            {' '}
            transformative power hidden within back-office optimization
          </span>{' '}
          and embarked on a mission to help businesses achieve operational
          excellence. From automating processes to integrating sophisticated
          software solutions, the right approach drives scalability and unlocks{' '}
          <span className="manrope-semibold"> significant cost savings</span>.
