            Our journey began in late 2022 when our founder,{' '}
            <span className="manrope-semibold">Courtney Walters</span>,
            recognized a critical gap in the business landscape. Having worked
            extensively within San Francisco's startup ecosystem, it became
            evident that while front-office functions like customer success and
            marketing received ample attention, back-office operations were
            often overlooked. This disparity stemmed from the misconception that
            operations lacked direct revenue generation potential.

            Drawing from firsthand experiences, Courtney realized the
