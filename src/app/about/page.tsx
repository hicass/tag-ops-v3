          Our Story

        </h2>

        <p className="mt-4">
          Our journey began in late 2022 when our founder, Courtney Walters,
          recognized a critical gap in the business landscape. Having worked
          extensively within San Francisco's startup ecosystem, it became
          evident that while front-office functions like customer success and
          marketing received ample attention, back-office operations were often
          overlooked. This disparity stemmed from the misconception that
          operations lacked direct revenue generation potential.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Drawing from firsthand experiences, Courtney realized the
          transformative power hidden within back-office optimization and
          embarked on a mission to help businesses achieve operational
          excellence. From automating processes to integrating sophisticated
          software solutions, the right approach drives scalability and unlocks
          significant cost savings.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          We believe that high-quality operational support is indispensable for
          every business regardless of its size, and understand that not all
          companies require a dedicated operations leader. We offer a holistic,
          flexible, customizable model to meet diverse needs. Our approach is
          rooted in collaboration, where we work closely with clients to craft
          tailored solutions that optimize efficiency without draining
          resources.

              I founded Tag Ops after 8 years of working in Operations in the
              San Francisco startup sphere. From Accounting & HR SaaS companies,
              to FinTech and Cryptocurrency, to Recruiting. Regardless of the
              industry, I'm incredibly adaptable, enjoy learning, and love
              problem solving. I have a fiery passion for helping small
              companies strategize and stay organized amongst the chaos of
              scaling. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking around the Bay Area,
              playing dnd and strategy-based RPGs, and spending time with my
              family, friends, and partner.
